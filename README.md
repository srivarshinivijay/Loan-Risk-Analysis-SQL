# 🏦 Loan Risk Analysis using Oracle SQL

## 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world banking loan risk analysis system. 
Using Oracle SQL, I analyzed customer credit profiles, loan approvals, 
and default patterns to identify high-risk borrowers and revenue trends.

The project demonstrates strong understanding of SQL joins, 
aggregations, CASE statements, subqueries, window functions, 
and risk segmentation logic.
